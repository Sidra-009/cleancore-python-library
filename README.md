**MathNexus** is a modular, object-oriented Python framework that provides a clean and intuitive implementation of **Linear Algebra** and **Analytical (Coordinate) Geometry**.  
It is designed with **learning, correctness, and extensibility** in mind — exposing how mathematical concepts translate into real software systems.

Unlike traditional numerical libraries that abstract away the internal logic, MathNexus focuses on **clarity over black-box computation**, making it especially suitable for:
- Students learning mathematics + programming
- Educators demonstrating mathematical modeling
- Developers building simulation or geometry-based tools
